# Stata Programs
Welcome to the site! This repository is a central location for Stata programs I've created (as well as a few I've taken from other sources and modified); feel free to download and use as needed. If you have any questions, you can email me at imaddowzimet@gmail.com

Any modified programs have their original authors and sources listed at the top, with a description of modifications.
